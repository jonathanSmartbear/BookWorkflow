# BookWorkflow

Here are the steps we'll take to look at this workflow.

1. Create a new version of our Book API in SwaggerHub
1. Save and push changes to a version-specific branch in GitHub
1. See failing payload tests, then build functionality
1. See passing tests, then open Pull Request
1. Merge to master
1. Publish and mark new version as default

add: test for no Rules violations or fail the PR
add: test for no Unresolved comments or fail the PR
